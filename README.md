# Hidden-Markov-Implemenation

## Overview
Welcome to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) implementation notebook! üåêüìä

This notebook demonstrates a simple yet powerful implementation of an HMM, a probabilistic model widely used in various applications, from weather prediction to natural language processing.

## Key Concepts
- **Definition:** Learn about the core concepts of HMMs.
- **Components:** Understand the building blocks, including initial distribution, transition distribution, observation distribution, and the Hidden Markov Model itself.

## Code Examples
Explore hands-on examples showcasing the versatility of HMMs:
1. **Categorical Data Example:** Apply HMM for a simple situation.
2. **Discrete Data Example** Predict the weather based on observed activities.


Each example includes code snippets and explanations to guide your understanding.

## How to Use
Get started with your own experiments! Follow the instructions in each example and tweak parameters to see how the model behaves.
